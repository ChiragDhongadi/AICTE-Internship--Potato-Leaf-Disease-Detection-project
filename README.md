## 📌 Overview

This project aims to detect and classify potato leaf diseases using deep learning. It leverages a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on a dataset of potato leaf images to identify diseases such as **Late Blight, Early Blight, and Healthy leaves**. The system provides an easy-to-use interface for farmers and agricultural experts to upload leaf images and receive instant disease predictions.

## 🚀 Features

- **Deep Learning-Based Detection:** Uses a CNN model for accurate classification.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with Streamlit for seamless image uploads and predictions.
- **High Accuracy:** Trained on a well-labeled dataset for optimal performance.
- **Real-Time Predictions:** Provides instant feedback on the uploaded image.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (Deep Learning Framework)
- **OpenCV** (Image Processing)
- **Streamlit** (Web App Interface)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Visualization)

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset consists of images of potato leaves categorized into three classes:

1. **Potato\_\_\_Late\_blight**
2. **Potato\_\_\_Early\_blight**
3. **Potato\_\_\_Healthy**

## 📊 Model Performance

Training and validation accuracy graphs show a steady increase, achieving a high accuracy of **90%+** on validation data, ensuring reliable predictions.

## 🎯 Usage

1. Open the Streamlit app.
2. Upload an image of a potato leaf.
3. Click on the **Predict** button.
4. The model will classify the disease and display the result.

## 🔍 Future Improvements

- Increase dataset size for better generalization.
- Improve model robustness against environmental factors (e.g., lighting conditions).
- Implement mobile-friendly deployment for on-the-go predictions.
